# Hello! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

Graduated in Advertising with a postgraduate degree in Digital Marketing, currently pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development while studying Full Stack Java development. Currently, I work in the technology field, focusing on software implementation. 

I am always seeking continuous learning, open to collaborations, and readily available for discussions about programming, projects, and much more.

Let's create something amazing together! ðŸš€
